Name, borthdate and zodiac sign

In the current project I wanted to create a simple program.

It works as following:

The strategy is to fill-in a last name, a middle name and a first name.
In case the middle name is missing, the operator is supposed to press either the ENTER button or simply type-in "None".
After filling-in the names from above, the operator should fill-in the birthdate, stept by step, the day, then the month and then the year.

In the end, after pressing the ENTER button, the result will display the last name, the middle name (if the case), the first name, the both date and the zodiac sign.
In case the birth date is not a real one, for example the day is bigger than 30 or 31 (depending on the month) or the month in bigger than 12, the program is showing a message, 
saying that the date or month is wrong and should try again.
